To-do list of what must be done to prepare the project for publishing in the App Store as a commercial product.

App development is a complex and iterative process that involves designing, building, testing, and deploying a software application for mobile devices. To prepare an app for publishing in the app store, developers typically follow these key steps:

1. Market Research and Global Idea
2. Business Plan
3. Comply with all legal requirements, privacy policies, permissions, access, data minimization, relevant data for core UI functionality, data usage, and sharing.
4. Design the app; ensure that your app is simple, refined, innovative, and easy to use. Come up with your own ideas and design.
5. Develop a fully functional app; test for crashes and bugs; optimize for performance and user experience.
6. Make sure you are familiar with App Store Guidelines.
7. Provide App Review with full access to your app; include detailed explanations of non-obvious features and in-app purchases in the App Review notes, including supporting documentation where appropriate.
8. Develop a marketing plan to promote the app; create a simple and understandable business model and in-app purchases. Expensive apps with irrationally high prices will be rejected.
9. Test the app on different devices, platforms, and systems.
10. Set up a system for user support and feedback; provide demo account information.
11. Collect metrics; track user behavior and app performance.
12. Make sure you do not contain false promotions; donâ€™t include hidden, dormant, or undocumented features.
13. Plan launch and post-launch activities to sustain user interest.
14. Keep monitoring and tracking app metrics and performance.
15. Create a plan for app growth and potential expansion into new markets and platforms.
